        <li>
          <strong>Personal background:</strong> I was born in New Jersey back in 1989 before my
          father moved our family down to North Carolina on Thanksgiving Day
          1996. I attended Providence High School class of 2007, where I met my
          beautiful wife in discrete math class–she had a “discreet” ninja on
          her binder and I immediately knew she was the one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional background:</strong> In high school, I got my first ever job at Old Navy, and
          after realizing I had no idea what a sequin was (nor any reason to
          care), I decided I despised working in retail and got a job at Ben &
          Jerry’s. After working at Ben &amp; Jerry’s for a year or two, I was
          offered a job by my dad’s girlfriend’s boss, working for a Managed
          Services Provider (MSP). After nearly seven years of working at the
          MSP, and building an extremely solid foundation in IT, I decided to
          leave and get a job as a desktop engineer at Wells Fargo. I remained
          at Wells Fargo as team lead for nearly a decade,moving into a role as
          a Cloud Platform Information Security Engineer, before finally
          settling into my true passion as a frontend Software Engineer. After
          leaving Wells Fargo, I had a short stint at AvidXchange (which you may
          recognize if you enjoy live music), before finally moving into my
          current role at Varo Bank, primarily focusing on our frontend / React
          Native web technology stack.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Academic background:</strong> I’ve been a student at CPCC since 2008–this time,
          I’m serious, and I’m going to finish my AAS degree!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Background in the subject matter of this course:</strong> My fascination with
          computers began all the way back in 1994, when my father brought home
          a 486DX running MS-DOS 6.0. I began working with HTML in the late
          ‘90s, tinkering away in Notepad before publishing to GeoCities and
          Tripod. Shortly thereafter, my interests moved toward desktop
          applications and I began developing in VB6 before my introduction to
          C# and the .NET world (thanks RunUO). After working for a Managed
          Services provider from 2008 to 2013, I finally embraced my passion for
          development and began a full-time career in the field, specifically
          the JavaScript / Node.js ecosystem.

          <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Linux — I started out with Gentoo and
          realized I don’t have the time to compile my entire OS. I shortly
          moved into utilizing both Slackware and Arch, before finally settling
          on Mint, which just works. After I got a new laptop, Mint wasn’t doing
          it for me anymore, so now I use KDE Neon, which isn’t really a real
          distro but still works great for me.

          <strong>Courses I'm taking and reason for each:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>CSC221 - Advanced Python Programming</strong>: Outside of CPCC, it’s been a long time since I’ve
              worked with Python, though being it’s so ubiquitous in the AI world, I
              absolutely feel it’s an important skill to have.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>WEB215 - Advanced Markup and Scripting</strong>: Though I’ve been a professional frontend
              developer for almost a decade, it’s always great to refresh on markup and
              scripting to keep my skills fresh.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <strong>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:</strong> I’m
          the guy who has been at CPCC since 2008 and still yet to attain my
          degree.
        </li>
        <li>
          My wife (a professional opera singer) and I love to travel the world
          and listen to live music–we went on our belated honeymoon back in
          May to June, where we had a three week long trip to LA, Hawaii, and all
          over Japan!
