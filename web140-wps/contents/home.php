<p>Welcome to my one page site for WEB140!</p>

<p>In this class, I’m learning how to create and manage websites using WordPress, one of the most popular platforms
  out
  there. From setting up themes to adding plugins and customizing pages, I’m gaining hands-on experience with
  everything
  WordPress has to offer.</p>

<p>By the end of the course, I’ll know how to build a fully functional and responsive website, even
  without being an expert coder. I’m excited to put these skills to use and create something amazing!</p>
