    <h2>Course Contract</h2>

    <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Charles L. Jones</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
      Fall 2024, WEB250, Database Driven Websites with my instructor,
      Professor D.I. von Briesen
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will
      not put
      information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
      failure to
      turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also understand that given the structure and content of this class itâ€™s possible to find many examples online or
      even
      view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and
      paste
      code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
    </p>
