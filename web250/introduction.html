      <li>
        Personal background: I was born in New Jersey back in 1989 before my
        father moved our family down to North Carolina on Thanksgiving Day
        1996. I attended Providence High School class of 2007, where I met my
        beautiful wife in discrete math class–she had a “discreet” ninja on
        her binder and I immediately knew she was the one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professional: In high school, I got my first ever job at Old Navy, and
        after realizing I had no idea what a sequin was (nor any reason to
        care), I decided I despised working in retail and got a job at Ben &
        Jerry’s. After working at Ben & Jerry’s for a year or two, I was
        offered a job by my dad’s girlfriend’s boss, working for a Managed
        Services Provider (MSP). After nearly seven years of working at the
        MSP, and building an extremely solid foundation in IT, I decided to
        leave and get a job as a desktop engineer at Wells Fargo. I remained
        at Wells Fargo as team lead for nearly a decade,moving into a role as
        a Cloud Platform Information Security Engineer, before finally
        settling into my true passion as a frontend Software Engineer. After
        leaving Wells Fargo, I had a short stint at AvidXchange (which you may
        recognize if you enjoy live music), before finally moving into my
        current role at Varo Bank, primarily focusing on our frontend / React
        Native web technology stack.

      <li>
        Academic background: I’ve been a student at CPCC since 2008–this time,
        I’m serious, and I’m going to finish my AAS degree!
      </li>
      <li>
        Background in the subject matter of this course: My fascination with
        computers began all the way back in 1994, when my father brought home
        a 486DX running MS-DOS 6.0. I began working with HTML in the late
        ‘90s, tinkering away in Notepad before publishing to GeoCities and
        Tripod. Shortly thereafter, my interests moved toward desktop
        applications and I began developing in VB6 before my introduction to
        C# and the .NET world (thanks RunUO). After working for a Managed
        Services provider from 2008 to 2013, I finally embraced my passion for
        development and began a full-time career in the field, specifically
        the JavaScript / Node.js ecosystem.

        Primary Computer Platform: Linux — I started out with Gentoo and
        realized I don’t have the time to compile my entire OS. I shortly
        moved into utilizing both Slackware and Arch, before finally settling
        on Mint, which just works. After I got a new laptop, Mint wasn’t doing
        it for me anymore, so now I use KDE Neon, which isn’t really a real
        distro but still works great for me.

        Courses I'm taking and reason for each:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>WEB250 - Data Driven Websites</b>: It’s been a long time since I’ve
            worked with PHP, so I feel that I’m going to really like this
            course as I remember thoroughly developing on a LAMP stack with
            PHP a long, long time ago.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting</b>: Though I’ve been a professional
            frontend developer for almost a decade, it’s always great to
            refresh on basic markup and scripting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>WEB140 - Web Development Tools</b>: I am very familiar with web
            development tools, but Wordpress is something I’m sorely lacking
            in knowledge, and being how widely it’s used, I feel this class
            will be a great introduction!
          </li>

        Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by: I’m
        the guy who has been at CPCC since 2008 and still yet to attain my
        degree.
      </li>
      <li>
        My wife (a professional opera singer) and I love to travel the world
        and listen to live music–we went on our belated honeymoon back in
        May->June, where we had a three week long trip to LA, Hawaii, and all
        over Japan!
