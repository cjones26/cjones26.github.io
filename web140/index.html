    <p class="center">Welcome to my Home page for WEB140!</p>

    <p>In this class, I’m learning how to create and manage websites using WordPress, one of the most popular platforms
      out
      there. From setting up themes to adding plugins and customizing pages, I’m gaining hands-on experience with
      everything
      WordPress has to offer.</p>

    <p>By the end of the course, I’ll know how to build a fully functional and responsive website, even
      without being an expert coder. I’m excited to put these skills to use and create something amazing!</p>
