    <h1>Charles Jones, WEB140-N801, Course Contract</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      I, Charles L. Jones agree to adbide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024, WEB140-N801 Web
      Development tools with my instructor, Ella McManus.

      I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world,
      and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
      failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

      Signed: Charles L. Jones, 08/18/2024
